Be cool and use [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and Ember together! This addon integrates Polymer with Ember, so you can use the power of custom web components in your ember apps today.

## Installation

```shell
ember install ember-polymer
```

## Usage

To use a custom element, just install it through bower.

```shell
bower install PolymerElements/paper-button --save
```

Done! ember-polymer identifies this package as a custom element and imports it automatically! âœ¨ You can now use the element:

```html
<paper-button raised>Raised button</paper-button>
```

## Demo

## Requirements

This addon forces Polymer to use Shadow DOM. Browsers that do not natively support Shadow DOM will be supplied with the [polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs). Note that this polyfill might result in slightly slower rendering.

## Configuration

### Manual imports

If an element is not automatically imported, it probably does not follow the polymer [naming conventions](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli#element-project-layout). To import it, create `elements.html` in `/app` and import the element:

```html
<link rel="import" href="../bower_components/some-element/some-element.html">
```

### Config variables

The addon can be configured in `config/environment.js` as such:

```js
ENV['ember-polymer'] = {
  option: 'value'
}
```

#### autoElementImport

Indicates whether elements should be imported automatically. ember-polymer automatically imports elements from bower and npm packages which have the `web-components` keyword and a valid [html import entry point](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli#element-project-layout). All elements at [customelements.io](https://customelements.io/) should be compatible.

Disable if you want full control over imports yourself. Defaults to `true`.

```js
  autoElementImport: true
```

#### excludeElements

A list with names of bower- or npm packages to exclude during auto element import. Comes in handy when you only want to manually import one specific file from a package, but not the entire element.

Defaults to `[]`.

```js
  excludeElements: ['paper-styles']
```

#### htmlImportsFile

File to put html imports in. If you do not have manual imports and are using `autoElementImport`, the file is not necessary.

Defaults to `app/elements.html`.

```js
  htmlImportsFile: 'app/elements.html'
```

#### vulcanizeOptions

Allows you to set [options](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize#using-vulcanize-programmatically) used in [vulcanize](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize).

Defaults to:

```js
  vulcanizeOptions: {
    inlineCss: true,
    inlineScripts: true
  }
```

#### vulcanizeOutput

The output file produced by [vulcanize](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize) for all vulcanized html code and styling.

Defaults to `assets/vulcanized.html`.

```js
  vulcanizeOutput: 'assets/vulcanized.html'
```
